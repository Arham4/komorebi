## What is Komorebi?

Komorebi is an awesome animated wallpaper manager for all Linux platforms.
It provides fully customizeable image, video, and web page wallpapers that can be tweaked at any time!

This is a fork of the original [Komorebi project](https://github.com/cheesecakeufo/komorebi) by [@cheesecakeufo](https://github.com/cheesecakeufo).

## Installing

Komorebi has been tested on:

- **Ubuntu** _18.04_
- **Elementary OS** _5.1.4_
- **Pop! OS** _20.04_
- **Fedora** _32_
- **Manjaro** _20.0.3_
- **Deepin** _20_
- **Arch Linux**
- **Gentoo**

### Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, Deepin, Elementary OS, Pop! OS, etc...)

Download the latest `.deb` package from our [releases page](https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi/releases/) and install it with:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i komorebi_2.2.0-1.deb
```

*(or by double-clicking on the downloaded file.)*

If you wish to compile it instead, then grab the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install meson valac libgtk-3-dev libgee-0.8-dev libclutter-gtk-1.0-dev libclutter-1.0-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libclutter-gst-3.0-dev
```

and jump to the [compiling section](#compiling).

### Fedora

**Fedora uses Wayland by default, which Komorebi doesn't support yet. You will have to switch to Xorg for the meantime.**

```bash
sudo dnf install meson vala gcc-c++ gtk3-devel clutter-devel clutter-gtk-devel clutter-gst3-devel webkit2gtk3-devel libgee-devel gstreamer1-libav
```

There is no `.rpm` package yet, jump to the [compiling section](#compiling); if you can package Komorebi for Fedora, go ahead and let us know!

### Arch Linux and derivatives (Manjaro, etc...)

Install from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/komorebi/):

```bash
yay -S komorebi
```

or grab the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo pacman -S meson vala gtk3 clutter clutter-gtk clutter-gst libgee
```

and jump to the [compiling section](#compiling).

## Compiling

Run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi.git
cd komorebi
meson build && cd build && meson compile
```

To install the compiled package:
```bash
meson install
```

## Using Komorebi

Simply run `komorebi`, or open your apps and look for **Komorebi**.

Optional arguments:

- `--single-screen`: forces Komorebi to run on the main screen only
- `version` or `--version`: prints current version

### Change wallpaper & desktop preferences
To change desktop preferences or your wallpaper, right click anywhere on the desktop to show the menu.

### Create custom wallpapers

Komorebi provides a simple tool to create your own wallpapers! Simply run `komorebi-wallpaper-creator` or open your apps and search for **Wallpaper Creator**.

![s1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi/master/screenshots/wallpaper_creator.jpg)

You can use either an image, a video, or a web page as a wallpaper and you have many different options to customize your very own wallpaper!

## Uninstalling

If you manually installed Komorebi, run the following on the cloned repository folder:

```bash
cd build
sudo ninja uninstall
```

If you didn't compile Komorebi from source, you can uninstall it through your package manager in the same way you would uninstall any other package.

## Questions? Issues?

### Komorebi is slow. What can I do about it?

Komorebi includes support for video wallpapers that might slow your computer down. There are a few tips you can do to increase performance, [detailed here](https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi/wiki/Improve-video-wallpapers-performance).

You can also disable support for video wallpapers altogether in 'Desktop Preferences' â†’ uncheck 'Enable Video Wallpapers'.

_note: you need to quit and re-open Komorebi after changing this option_

### Komorebi is crashing and I'm using two or more screens!

This is a [known bug](https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi/issues/18) that currently has no good solution in the meantime :(

For now, you can force Komorebi to launch on the main screen only by running it with `--single-screen`.

### After uninstalling, my desktop isn't working right (blank or no icons)

The latest version should already have a fix for this issue. If you've already uninstalled Komorebi and would like to fix the issue, simply run this (in the Terminal):
`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi/master/data/Other/postrm | bash -s`

If your issue has not already been reported, please report it [here](https://github.com/Komorebi-Fork/komorebi/issues/new).

### Thanks To:

Pete Lewis ([@PJayB](https://github.com/PJayB)) for adding multi-monitor support
